//! Keep a Python and a venv, run the app, apply updates: the launcher, in the desktop app.
//!
//! The heavy half — a `CPython` and ~330 MB of wheels — is installed once by the bundled `uv`
//! into a per-user folder ([`home`]); an update is just this project's wheel, a few megabytes.
//!
//! This process is the *parent* of the app, which is what makes updating safe. Windows keeps a
//! running process's extension modules open, so an install over a live app fails half-way.
//! Here the app writes the version it wants and exits, the install happens with nothing
//! running, and the app starts again.
//!
//! Two venv slots, one live and one spare: an update builds the spare and flips a pointer, so a
//! failed install cannot touch what works, and a version that will not start is stepped back
//! out of. The folder, its files and what the app reads from them are the Python launcher's, so
//! an install it made carries straight over.
