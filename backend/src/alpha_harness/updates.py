"""Is a newer release out, and asking the launcher to install it.

The app never upgrades itself in place. On Windows a running process keeps its extension
modules open, so an install that touches ``duckdb`` or ``numpy`` fails part-way and leaves a
broken tree behind. The launcher supervises the app instead, on Windows, macOS and Linux alike:
Update writes the wanted version to a file, the app exits, the launcher installs that version
with ``uv`` and starts the app again.

The file is what matters, not the restart. If the app cannot close itself the request still
sits there, and the next start applies it — so a failed shutdown costs the user one manual
restart rather than the update.

Run without the launcher — a development checkout, or the ``uvx --from`` route in CLAUDE.md —
there is nothing to hand the request to. Updates then report themselves unavailable and say
why, rather than failing at the last step.
