Free-tier quota is per account, so several keys add their budgets together. Rotation picks
by *headroom* rather than round-robin, which spreads load evenly and so is exactly wrong
when one key is nearly spent and another is untouched.

Keys are sealed with the same sealer as the BRAIN password and never leave the backend; the
