"""Fields Sampler: one Alpha re-run with each of its data fields swapped for others.

One field changes at a time and everything else holds, so a search that would pair every
field with every other is a line through each field instead. Two ways to pick the others:

- **Sweep**: every other field of the same dataset.
- **Similar**: the fields whose descriptions read closest to this one's, the closest few from
  the same dataset, then the same subcategory, the same category, and the whole market.
- **Buckets**: for an Alpha reading several fields of one dataset, every field of it in the
  bucket of the one it is most like (:mod:`.field_buckets`), and every field swapped at once,
  one from each bucket's top picks. Held one at a time, the parts would still add the same
  information.

In Sweep and Similar a variant nothing refused becomes a seed itself, and the task sweeps it
the same way, so a good swap is followed by the next one until the task's simulations run out.

Only what BRAIN itself implies is filtered: a field must exist in the Alpha's market, be of
the same type (a ``vec_`` operator wraps a VECTOR field, nothing a MATRIX one), and not be
one of the dates or symbol identifiers BRAIN advises against.
