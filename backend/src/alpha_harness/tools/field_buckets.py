"""One dataset's fields split into a bucket per field an Alpha reads, for swapping them together.

An Alpha that adds two fields of one dataset works because each part carries its own
information, so a variant has to change both parts, each into something of its own kind. Every
field of the dataset goes to the seed field it is most like *in the way the seeds differ*:
with ``..._earnings_...`` and ``..._revenue_...`` as seeds, an EPS field goes with the first and
a sales field with the second, whatever else they share.

1. Each field is a TF-IDF vector of its id's words and, weighted lower, its description's.
   Ids are systematic within a dataset; descriptions are written in several styles, and a
   style is not a meaning.
2. The seeds' contrast is each seed's vector less their mean, words only: a variant number
   (``_3`` against ``_4``) tells nothing apart.
3. A field naming what tells the seeds apart goes with the seed it names. Every other field
   takes its bucket from its neighbours: the contrast spread over a nearest-neighbour graph
   (Zhou et al., "Learning with Local and Global Consistency", 2004), so a family of fields
   stays together.

Each bucket is then ordered for picking: greedily, the field that best represents what the
picks so far do not (facility location, weighted by coverage), so the top few are different
signals rather than one concept at five horizons. On the vault's two-field Alphas, no field
statistic predicted a pair's Sharpe (|rho| < 0.05 within a template), so spreading the picks is
what a short list can do.
