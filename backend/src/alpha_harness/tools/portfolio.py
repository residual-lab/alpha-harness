"""The Portfolio page: submitted Alphas combined at equal weight.

Equal weight is what BRAIN itself does. Its own pool figure (``before-and-after-performance``)
is the mean of the members' daily PnL and turnover over the days it exported, leaving out the
final days each Alpha's own figures count. Filtered to one partition (region, delay, Power Pool
or Regular), this reproduces it to the dollar, measured, in total and every yearly row.

Across regions the calendars differ, so the headline puts every Alpha on the union of their
trading days, counting a day an Alpha did not trade as zero: once it has started, each Alpha
keeps an equal share of capital whether or not its market was open.
