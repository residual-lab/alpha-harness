"""The simulation record's lifecycle: the rules every row follows, whoever drives it.

Both :class:`~alpha_harness.engine.tracker.SimulationTracker` (one simulation at a time)
and :class:`~alpha_harness.engine.slots.BatchEngine` (multi-simulations) move the same
``SimulationRecord`` rows through the same statuses, so what must be identical between
them lives here: the compare-and-set that changes a status, the durable write of a
platform id, how a finished body maps to a local outcome, the write that ends a row, and
the dedup memory.

Re-running an identical alpha consumes quota for nothing — the platform counts it even
though the alpha already exists — so the full request is hashed to recognise a repeat.
