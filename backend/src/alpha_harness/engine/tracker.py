"""Simulation lifecycle tracking.

The one invariant that matters: **a simulation id is never held only in memory.** A
``201`` from ``POST /simulations`` returns the id *only* in the ``Location`` header, and
for a multi-simulation that id is the sole handle that can cancel the batch — lose it and
the simulation runs on, holding a concurrency slot, unstoppable.

So :meth:`SimulationTracker.submit` writes a row *before* the HTTP request and updates
it with the id the instant the response lands. A crash between the two leaves a
``PENDING`` row, which :meth:`reconcile` surfaces rather than silently discards.
