"""Template Lab: a Fast Expression with ``$variables``, searched for the best Sharpe.

A template is written the way BRAIN reads an Alpha, ``x = ...;`` lines naming its steps and
the last line the Alpha, with a ``$name`` wherever the search chooses. Each variable is
defined beside the template: **fields** from chosen datasets, or **values** typed as a list
of numbers, groups, operator names or whole expressions. Written as ``$name(...)`` it is an
operator. A name takes one value per Alpha, however often it is written.

A task freezes its template, each variable's choices and the settings it searches when it is
added. The search then asks, define-by-run: the universe, every variable in the order it is
first written, the neutralization and the investability constraint.
