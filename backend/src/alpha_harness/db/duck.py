"""DuckDB store for the data catalog.

A second engine because the catalog is ~85k fields *per* (instrumentType, region, delay,
universe) tuple and the Data Explorer's queries are columnar set operations across those
tuples. SQLite keeps the transactional state that must never be lost; DuckDB keeps the
bulk data that can always be re-synced.

The driver is synchronous and a connection is not safe for concurrent use, so writes are
serialised behind a lock, all off the event loop. Reads take their own cursor instead, which
MVCC lets run beside a write, so a long correlation read never stalls a sync.
