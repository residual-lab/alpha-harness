"""Sign-in and session lifecycle.

Sessions persist on the platform, so the expensive part — solving the ALTCHA
proof-of-work — should happen rarely. The flow is always:

    restore the cookie jar -> GET /authentication -> still valid? done.
                                                  -> expired? solve captcha, sign in.

The captcha is required on sign-in, and repeated failures lock the account, so sign-in
is never attempted speculatively.
